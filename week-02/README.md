# Week 02 — Sales & Customer Behaviour Insights (Green Cart Ltd)

## Overview
This project explores sales performance and customer behaviour to identify profitability drivers, customer segments, and seasonal patterns. The outcome is a set of evidence-based recommendations to support commercial planning and 2025 focus areas.

## Business Questions
- Which product categories and suppliers deliver the strongest profit margins?
- How do customer demographics (age, location) and loyalty tiers influence purchasing behaviour?
- What seasonal patterns exist across categories and regions?
- Which acquisition channels are associated with higher customer value?

## What I Delivered
- Data cleaning and preparation for analysis and reporting
- Joins across sales, customer, and product datasets
- Profitability analysis by category and supplier
- Customer segmentation by age band and loyalty tier
- Time-series analysis for seasonality and trend interpretation

## Key Insights (high level)
- Profit is concentrated in a subset of categories and suppliers; some high-revenue areas underperform on margin.
- Loyalty tier and age band show meaningful differences in purchasing behaviour and value.
- Clear seasonality signals support campaign timing and inventory planning.
- Acquisition channels vary in value; investment should be aligned to lifetime value, not just volume.


## Recommendations
- Prioritise high-margin categories and top-performing suppliers for 2025 growth.
- Design targeted loyalty offers for lower tiers with clear upgrade pathways.
- Plan marketing and stock around seasonal peaks; reduce exposure during predictable dips.
- Allocate budget towards acquisition channels associated with higher customer value.
